		<h1>What About FlashingDeals?</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="page_content">
		<p>FlashingDeals is the result of two best friends growing up with a passion for finding things at great prices. Whether it was a video game, the newest toy, or tickets to the amusement park, we always found a way of making it happen.</p>
		<p>Getting the most bang for your buck on a weekly allowance of five dollars took some creativity. Flipping through ads, trading for used games, and cutting out coupons was only the beginning. With these past experiences and philosophies, we present you with FlashingDeals.</p>
		<p>FlashingDeals is a platform for people to find things they love and share things they buy. We believe the things we do, the things we use, and the things we wear are merely extensions of who we are. Here at FlashingDeals you can express just that.</p>
